Copyleaks Python SDK
======================

Copyleaks (http://www.copyleaks.com) Python SDK

Installing dependencies
------------------------

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt by running (from the root):

::

    > pip install -r requirements.txt

Setup
------

You can setup the project by downloading the source code and then running the following command:

::

    > python setup.py install

Once installed you should get your API key from http://copyleaks.com and you can get started. For example, here
is how you can count credits

::

    >>> from copyleaks_sdk.copyleaks import CopyLeaks
    >>> self.copyleak = CopyLeaks(YOUR USERNAME HERE, API KEY HERE)
    >>>
    >>> def test_count_credits(self):
    >>>     credit = self.copyleak.count_credits()

And here is how you can create a process by file:

::

    >>> response = self.copyleak.create_process_by_file('full_path_of_file.txt')

There are tests available, kindly look at them for some example code.

Tests
------

Firstly, in order for tests to run you need a config.py under tests directory containing API credentials. For example,
we will have a file tests/config.py with following contents:

::

    username = 'USERNAME HERE'
    api_key = 'API KEY GOES HERE'

You can find tests under copyleaks-python-sdk/tests. Tests are written the built-in unittest module and can simply
be run from the command line.
